1. Introduction to this section  
The author guides you through this Python refresher course.  
2. Variables in Python  
Here, we look at variables which are just names for values, which can be reuse and reset. Python is a dynamic typed language, which means variables don't need be constrained to a specific type.  
3. Solution to coding exercise: Variables  
Solution to “Variable” Python coding exercise.  
4. Methods in Python  
In this video, let's look at methods in Python by creating some examples and using just one keyword: def.  
5. Solution to coding exercise: Methods  
Solution to the “Method” Python coding exercise.  
6. Lists, tuples, and sets  
In this video, we look at three essential data structures in Python: lists, tuples, and sets. A list is an ordered collection of items. A tuple is an immutable ordered collection of items. A set is an unordered collection of unique items.  
7. List, tuple, and set operations  
Learn the number of ways by which we can interact with lists, tuples and sets.  
8. Advanced set operations  
We look at advanced set operations: calculating items which are in two sets, or items which are in one set but not another.  
9. Solution to coding exercise: Lists, tuples, sets  
Solution to the "Lists, tuples, and sets" Python coding exercise.
 . Loops in Python  
This video explores two different types of loop in Python: for loop and while loop.  
11. If statements  
This video explores how to create programs which can change depending on some input using if statements.  
12. Solution to coding exercise: Flow control  
Solution to the "Flow control" Python coding exercise.  
13. A programming exercise for you  
Coding exercise along the videos.  
14. List comprehension  
List comprehension is relatively unique to Python and allows us to use a “for” loop inside a list to generate values.  
15. Dictionaries  
Learn more about dictionaries.  
16. Are dictionaries "things"?  
An introduction to how we might shift our way of thinking, from data only, to things and objects.  
17. Solution to coding exercise: Dictionaries  
Solution to the "Dictionaries and students" Python coding exercise.
18. Objects in Python  
Objects are the natural progression from dictionaries. Instead of just holding data, objects hold another special type of data: methods. A method is a function which operates on the object calling it. Learn more about objects.  
19. A Student example  
This video looks at an example of Object-Oriented Programming by creating a Student class.  
20. Solution to coding exercise: Classes and objects  
Solution to the "Classes and objects" Python coding exercise.  
21. @classmethod and @staticmethod  
Learn more about @classmethod and @staticmethod are two decorators which extend the capabilities of methods.  
22. Solution to coding exercise: @classmethod and @staticmethod  
Solution to the "@classmethod and @staticmethod" Python coding exercise.  
23. Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming  
This video shows essentially that a class contains all of the properties and methods of the class it inherits from.  
24. args and **kwargs  
Learn ways of passing arguments.  
25. Passing functions as arguments  
Passing functions yield can sometimes yield a very powerful method in very few lines of code.  
26. Decorators in Python  
Learn concept of decorators.    
27. Advanced decorators  
In this video we look at advanced decorators in Python, which is decorators that take arguments.  
28. Conclusion of this section  
In this conclusive video, we get ready to move onto bigger and better things.
